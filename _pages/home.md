<!-- Welcome to the Advanced Wireless Systems Group. Our group focuses on both experimental and theoretical aspects of research related to wireless communications and network systems. -->

Our flagship research prior to 2018 has been [physical-layer network coding](http://www.inc.cuhk.edu.hk/research/projectsphysical-layer-network-coding-pnc) (PNC), a wireless-networking concept first put forth by the group in 2006.

### Going forward, three research focuses of the group will be

1. Industrial wireless networks for IIoT communication (particularly specialized clean-slate network designs for the factory setting rather than Wi-Fi or 5G networks for general applications).

2. AI-driven wireless communications system and wireless networks.

3. Network protocol and network architecture designs for blockchain, with the aim to boost transaction throughput.

(see [Research](research.html) for more details).

### Some representative publications by the group in these directions are as follows:
