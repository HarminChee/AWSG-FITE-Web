<!-- Welcome to the Advanced Wireless Systems Group. Our group focuses on both experimental and theoretical aspects of research related to wireless communications and network systems. -->

### Research focuses of the group

**AI4Net & Net4AI:** In the domain of “AI for Networks”, we develop advanced AIs that empower the next-generation smart networks and enable a user-friendly human-network interface. In the domain of “Networks for AI”, we are particularly interested in distributed AI systems facilitated by cutting-edge wireless/wired networks.

**Wireless Industrial Networks:** We solve real-world wireless communication problems specialized for industrial application settings with critical latency and reliability concerns.

**Blockchain and Cryptos:** We design novel network protocols and architectures for blockchain and study the price dynamics of cryptos.
