# Real-time Time-slotted System on SDR

## Overview

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/rtts_sdr.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="50%"/>

RTTS-SDR is a system that we implemented on PC-USRP using GNURadio. It can achieve synchronization among nodes and aligned their time slots to within 100ns, and the end-to-end latency can be down to **3.75ms**.

The prototype is implemented on [USRP/GNURadio](http://www.ettus.com/) software-defined platform. We used USRP X310 and the UBX daugherboard. The key features are as follows:

* OFDM-based (with parameters similar to 802.11);
* Support all bitrates introduced in 802.11a/b/g. Modulation and channel code can be changed on packet-based.
* CP-length and subcarrier mapping can be reconfigured easily.
